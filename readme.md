# Overview

This software gives the fundamental tools to sort through CSV files with python. Making software like this is essential for python programming. When working with large datasets, there needs to be an efficient way to work with them with no manual input from the sorter. 

This dataset includes the average life expectancy of every country since they started tracking these statistics.

I wrote this code to analyze the life expectancy of different countries and to compare them to each other. I find this information to be fascinating and informative for one’s world view.

# Data Analysis Results

After I went through the data, I found some interesting things. The highest lifetime in the dataset is 86 years in Monaco. The most shocking number was the lowest age being only 17 years in Iceland. My guess is that this was from high infant mortality, but I haven’t researched into it.
